            <h1>Midvaal</h1>
            <p>Midvaal Local Municipality led by Executive Mayor Cllr. Bongani Baloyi has been coined the fastest growing municipality
                in Gauteng due to its rapid economic growth. Midvaal has undergone a radical change from quaint country area
                to booming tourist, recreational and industrial centre in Southern Gauteng. Midvaal has grown from 60 000
                residents in 2001 to 100 000 today. A report by Gauteng’s Provincial Government ranked Midvaal as the province's
                top municipality in terms of quality of life. Midvaal is ranked within the top 10% of high scoring local
                municipalities in South Africa.</p>

            <p>Midvaal’s name has become more prominent with the establishment of the Oprah Winfrey School located in the area.
                In addition to this one of golf's most successful and recognisable stars Greg Norman coined “the Great White
                Shark” invested huge amounts of money into the Eye of Africa Golfing Estate development for which he designed
                the golf course. The municipality’s major achievement has been attracting Sedibeng Breweries, South Africa’s
                distributors of Heineken into the area. The brewery has set up its national offices along Midvaal R59 freeway
                and has brought with it new opportunities for job creation and small businesses.</p>
